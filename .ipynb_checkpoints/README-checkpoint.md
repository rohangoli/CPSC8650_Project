MRI_Keras_facial_feature.py - used for training the model to classify if facial feature is present.
MRI_Keras_Brain_feature_loss.py - used for training the model to classify if brain voxels are removed.
predict_facial_feature_brain_feature_loss.ipynb - used for predicting the presence of facial feature and brain voxels removed.
autoencoder-2.py - training the model to reconstruct the facail features.
3d_brain_feature_loss_model.h5 - trained model to classify if brain voxels are removed.
